# License Feature Example
Babel Obfuscator includes a licensing feature that allows you to generate feature-based licenses for your obfuscated code. This means that you can create licenses that unlock specific features or functionality within your application based on the license key that is provided.
One way to implement this is by using code encryption in combination with Babel Licensing. You can use Babel Obfuscator to encrypt your code and then generate a license key that unlocks specific encrypted sections of the code. This way, you can provide different license levels or feature sets based on the user's needs.

The full example documentation is available in the [Babel Obfuscator Manual](https://docs.babelfor.net/examples/code-encryption/feature-based-licenses)
